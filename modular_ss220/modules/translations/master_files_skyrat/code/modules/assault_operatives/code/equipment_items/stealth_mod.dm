	desc = "A rarely seen MOD design of unknown origin, covered in sleek armor and with a menacingly solid faceplate."
	extended_desc = "Not all that much is known about this type of suit, dubbed the 'Covert' type by most who come across it. \
		The build is a streamlined layering consisting of shaped Plastitanium, and composite ceramic, while the under suit is \
		lined with a lightweight Kevlar and durathread hybrid weave to provide ample protection to the user where the plating \
		doesn't, with an illegal onboard electric powered ablative shield module to provide resistance against conventional \
		energy firearms. In addition, it has an in-built chameleon system, allowing you to disguise the suit while undeployed. \
		Aside from that, there are no manufcaturer marks or tags to be found, and even the color scheme is unfamiliar when \
		it comes to most known MOD producers."
