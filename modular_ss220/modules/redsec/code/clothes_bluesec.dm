/*
*	SS220: Bluesec items.
*
*	Tips:
*		- I used `current_skin` for disabling skin choose
		- If you're not sure why you can't select a skin (but you have one), you may need to set `current_skin` to null
*		- All clothing is took his path from his parent, so you should override it on your code if you need it
*		- Make sure every icon, worn_icon, icon_state, inhand_icon_state is correct
*
*	There's may be some `not needed` overridings but it'll took ages for me to clean this up
