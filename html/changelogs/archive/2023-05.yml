      from known behavior. They should be a lot more intelligent now though.
  - rscadd: AI Spiderlings are super fragile, but they're also super fast, especially
      when they get into a vent. Once they're in circulation, they could end up everywhere!
      Maybe in the armory, maybe in a locked closet in maintenance. Be sure to be
      vigilant and splat them whenever you can to save the station from a whole lotta
      heartache!

      (export-preferences) should now be available in the OOC tab of your stat-panel
      if enabled by server operators.
  - server: Exporting player preferences is controlled by a configuration option,
      'FORBID_PREFERENCES_EXPORT'. If you do not wish to let clients access the ftp()
      function to their own preferences file (probably for bandwidth reasons?) you
      should uncomment this or add it to your config somehow.

      the limb for a little brute and some burn.

      EMPs on robotic limbs will now disable them for 10-20 seconds rather than causing
      a 10-20 second full stun on the user. Additionally, they will damage the limb
      for a little brute and some burn.'
  - balance: Arm EMPs don't do anything special as the limb being disabled already
      drops items.
  - balance: Leg EMPs cause a 10-20 second knockdown, only really applicable if there's
      only one robotic leg as two disabled legs KD you anyways.
